Aggie Code of Honor
For many years Aggies have followed a Code of Honor, which is stated in this very simple verse:

An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.

The Aggie Code of Honor is an effort to unify the aims of all Texas A&M men and women toward a high code of ethics and personal dignity. For most, living under this code will be no problem, as it asks nothing of a person that is beyond reason. It only calls for honesty and integrity, characteristics that Aggies have always exemplified.

The Aggie Code of Honor functions as a symbol to all Aggies, promoting understanding and loyalty to truth and confidence in each other.



Assembler transfers Assembly Code to Machine Code
Dissassembler transfers Machine Code to Assembly Code

This facilitates communication between the programmar and the computer as the programmar types in Assembly Code that is easily understood and then converted to 1 and 0 bits in binary machine code to execute commands.
